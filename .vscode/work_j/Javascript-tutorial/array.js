/*array method*/
/*Some commonly used methods include push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice(), concat(), slice(), indexOf(), forEach(), map(), filter(), and many more.*/ 

/*Accessing Elements:*/ 

/* You can access individual elements in an array using square brackets [] and specifying the index of the element. For example: names[0] would give you "Alice", and names[2] would give you "Charlie"*/

/*Modifying Elements:*/ 
 /*You can change the value of an element in an array by assigning a new value to a specific index. For example: names[1] = "Bob Smith" would change the second element to "Bob Smith"*/


 /*terating Over Arrays:*/ 
 
 /*You can loop over the elements of an array using various looping constructs like for loops, while loops, or array-specific methods such as forEach(), map(), or for...of loop*/
